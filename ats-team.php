    <h1>Advanced Training Systems</h1>
    <h2>The Company behind the TransMaster Training Platform</h2>
    
<div id="left">
<p>Advanced Training Systems (ATS) is a newly formed company created to meet the needs of the full spectrum of driver training needs.  it is comprised of three companies:</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="red" href="roadmaster.php">Career Path Training Corporation (CPTC)</a><br><br><b>CPTC has graduated over 50,000 roadmaster drivers and has significant behind-the-wheel training experience in addition to blended learning techniques using simulation, CBT, classroom and web instruction.</b></li>
<li><a class="red" href="iti.php">Instructional Technologies, Inc. (ITI)</a><br><br><b>ITI is a National leader in Web and Computer-Based Training for commercial drivers, having provided over 2 million lessons to commercial truck drivers.</b></li>
<li><a class="red" href="ast.php">Applied Simulation Technologies (AST)</a><br><br><b>AST (formally I-Sim and GE/I-Sim) is an expert in simulator design, simulator-based training software and Instructional Systems Design.</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Each member is a proven leader in its distinctive field:</b></p>

<p>CPTC owns and operates RoadMaster Driver Training Schools and specialty medical training schools and has significant behind-the-wheel training experience in addition to blended learning techniques using simulation, CBT, classroom and web instruction.  </p>

<p>ITI is a National leader in Web and Computer-Based Training for commercial drivers, having provided over 2 million lessons to commercial truck drivers.  </p>

<p>AST (formally I-Sim and GE/I-Sim) is expert in simulator design, simulator-based training software and Instructional Systems Design. </p>

<p>Together these three companies created a “world-class” organization designed to bring their vast expertise and past success to driver training customers.  ATS is focused on affordable, effective training and dedicated to the proposition that customers know what they want if you just listen.</p>

<h2>ATS Advantages</h2>

<p>Each member’s expertise is different yet complementary; providing a complete approach to synthetic training.  As a training solutions company, ATS’s individual members do not lose their distinctive uniqueness; they gain a collective strength. This strategic collaboration positions ATS to offer many advantages for its clients; some immediately recognizable ones include:</p>

<ol>
<li>One responsible point of contact (ATS) for a complete training package </li>

<li>One company that combines financial strength, technical competence, training leadership, and a heritage of recognized successes in training innovations</li>

<li>One source that designs its subsystems to have system level compatibility and system level optimized performance</li>

<li>A system’s level training design that integrates the latest in various technologies and best-practices specific to the customer’s training objectives (design harmony)</li>

<li>A planned training system designed to accommodate scalability, expandability,  student through-put, updated technology as modular components to a training system, level-to-level compatibility of software and continuity of student proficiency and performance measurement records and reports at all levels. </li>
</ol>

<p>ATS can offer the combined expertise normally expected from a larger systems company like CAE or Lockheed Martin with a small company’s specific expertise, flexibility, responsiveness, and low overhead.</p>
