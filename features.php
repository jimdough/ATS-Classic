    <h1>Transmaster Features</h1>

<div id="left">
<p><b>The TransMaster™ Transmission Shifter Simulator’s basic functional features consist of the following:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>The simulator includes 3 basic lessons on transmission shifting; including driver measurement software, interactive and adaptive CBT and statistical analysis software.</li>
<li>TransMaster’s™ reliability is improved over ten times that experienced in traditional simulator systems. This extended Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) means less down time/cost and more training value. Hence, a 2 year factory warranty.</li>
<li>Visual system upgrade provides a 3-channel 180° HFOV view using 3-channels each with a minimum of 1600 x 1200 image resolution using PC-based, Direct-X  image generation hardware.</li>
<li>Reconfigurable dashboard using a glass cockpit arrangement replicates gauges and their placement in various types of vehicles.</li>
<li>Interactive rear-view mirrors and convex mirror views react to head position and change view as would real mirror images.</li>
<li>Retractable clutch pedal can be moved out of the way when not required.</li>
<li>Digital surround sound system simulating normal vehicle operating sounds, including engine, skidding and collisions as well as environmental sounds.</li>
<li>A road surface database model allows the simulator’s vehicle dynamics and tire models to correctly interact resulting in appropriate simulator response. </li>
<li>Multi-DOF vehicle dynamics software samples the road surface at 1,000 Hz</li>
<li>All subsystems, including vehicle dynamics, sound, visual, mechanical and scenario control, operate in a correlated manner, synchronized with one-another in real-time.</li>
<li>Courseware is interactive with selected driving databases and training scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Simulator Features</h1>
<ul>
	<li>3/4 to full scale</li>
	<li>Reconfigurable cockpit</li>
	<li>Head tracker for mirror view adjustment, wireless operation</li>
	<li>Remotely programmable</li>
	<li>embedded targeted training  and digital instructor</li> 
</ul>

<h1>Training Management and Record Keeping</h1>
<h2>Individual Company Driver Database:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access 24/7; Records driver name, lesson taken, completion date</li>
<li>Trainer can generate a number of reports</li>
<li>Driver can be given certificate of completion for each lesson</li>
<li>Second party record-keeping very important in litigation</li>
<li>Over 2 million lessons recorded</li>
</ul>
